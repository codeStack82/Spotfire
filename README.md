# Spotfire
This repository is a compilation of Spotfire IronPython scripts that I use.

1) Spotfire file is quick way to access a web api using ironpython within Spotfire and then print the data to the console (for testing purposes)

 2) Uses ironpython to get the value of a marked Spotfire row  - Valu can then be put into a document porperty
